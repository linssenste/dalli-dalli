# Geo Dalli-Dalli

A geography game inspired by GeoGuessr and Dalli-Klick, an old German TV game. This project was built with Vue3 and Vite and is currently deployed on Vercel.

## Game Concept

An image, representing a Point of Interest (POI) on the map, is hidden by randomly sized and placed triangles. With each iteration, a triangle is removed, revealing more information about the image. The magic is always in the detail! 

Each game consists of five individual rounds where you have the potential to earn up to 5000 points. The task is to locate the POI on the map. The closer the guess and the less of the image is uncovered (visibility), the higher the round score. A perfect score is definitely possible!

## Customization

You can adjust the number of triangles that cover the image. More triangles means less of the image is visible with each reveal, increasing the difficulty. You can also set the intervals at which the triangles disappear. For those who prefer complete control, there's an option to manually dictate the reveal rate.

## Future Plans

The game is currently designed for desktop use (medium to large horizontal screens). Plans for a mobile solution are underway.
